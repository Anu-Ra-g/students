# CNCF Student Ambassador Program
(Q: Name isn't finalised)

Are you a Cloud Native & community enthusiast? We are presenting the CNCF Student Ambassador program! We believe that Open Source is a great way for students to learn, collaborate, and get real-world experience from the comfort of their homes. As a CNCF Student Ambassador, you'll be starting the CNCF Student Community under the global [CNCF Student community](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-students/) for your local group/university. You'll get to be a part of a large network of Cloud Native enthusiasts who are there to support you and the work that you do for the community. 

## What we look for
Active in any of the Cloud Native projects either as a contributor/event organiser.
Passionate about building communities
Good communication skills
Additional Open Source & community experiences are appreciated
(Q: Do we want them to be students?)

## Responsibilities

As a CNCF Student Ambassador, you'll be responsible to share about various Cloud Native technologies and help students in getting started with their Open Source journey, network and grow. This can be achieved via conducting webinars, workshops, events such as a hackathon, anything that you feel would benefit your community members.
We also encourage you to have third party speakers such as experienced mentors from the industry interact with the students. You can do this by collaborating with other CNCF communities. 
In addition to this, we also want the community members to enhance their skills and apply those in real-world projects. This can be done via sharing learning resources such as coursework, events, helping them get started as a contributor in a particular project, etc.
Note that these are just a few of the examples, you can experiment and try out new things you build your community and empower its members.

## Support from CNCF
To support your work, you'll be receiving the following support from CNCF:
Swag for events
Support in terms of getting speakers
Mentorship in terms of leading a community
Private CNCF Student Ambassadors Slack channel for questions/queries
Coupons for events
(Q: Need confirmation and more details here)

## Other events
We'll be having monthly CNCF Student Ambassadors call where you'll get to meet other ambassadors from around the world and share the good work that you are doing. During these calls, we'll be discussing how to scale your communities, and some of the best practices to follow. It's also a place to ask questions, give/receive feedback, and learn from others.

TBD: We are also planning to have a global CNCF Students Community meetup at KubeCon, where you'll get to meet the community members from around the world as well as a chance to share your story.
